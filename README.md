# MNIST-Classifiers-and-Autoencoder
Implementing two Autoencoders for generating the next handwritten digit. One model is a Fully Connected Neural Network and another is Convolutional Neural Network. Also, two MNIST classifiers have been implemented too. One is a Fully Connected Neural Network model and another is Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier.
